# SentimentTracker
run pip install requirements.txt.

Twitter API required for project!

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a place for people to see real time analysis of public opinion on various topics.

## What it does
Using TensorFlow and the twitter API, we use sentiment analysis to show public opinion via line and bar graphs.

## How we built it
We built this project using the Django Framework for python.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was not having enough access to the twitter API in order to run fast. We also couldn't find labeled twitter data for training our sentiment model.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud about how we were able to create a 'trends' page based by region where a user can click on a topic and be displayed a sentiment dashboard.

## What we learned
We learned that we can never underestimate a task! No matter how trivial it may seem, you never know what obstacles you may run into.

## What's next for Public Sentiment Tracker
We would like to polish out the frontend, make requests faster and add a loading page after the search form is submitted. In addition, we would like to beef up the dashboards to include keywords and top tweets on the topic 

**In order to use the project, you must have tweepy access tokens in a .env.py file located at project root.**
